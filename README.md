# Bank-Management-System
  We developed a comprehensive Bank Account Management System using C++ to handle basic banking operations such as account creation, balance inquiry, and account verification. This project showcases strong skills in object-oriented programming, file handling, and user interface design.

# Key Features:
  # Account Creation: 
  Users have the ability to initiate the opening of a new bank account by entering an account number and creating a strong password. The account information is then securely stored in a text file.
  
  We have successfully created an account with the account number 1234 and the password "qwerty."

  After inputting the data and pressing the "enter" key, it will be stored in a text file.
